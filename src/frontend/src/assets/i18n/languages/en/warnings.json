  "deepSearch": "It is not mandatory to fill in the API; it has default values. The value of the maximum search depth deep_search_limit defines the limit of results that the system will attempt to collect from the external databases (HAL, ACM, Springer) for your request. The system will make multiple calls (pagination) to the libraries' APIs until this number is reached, ensuring that your search does not overload the external servers or exceed usage limits.A larger value is recommended if the search is generic and needs a more comprehensive overview, and a smaller value if it is specific. This number represents the maximum limit of attempts by the server to aggregate results, not the number of articles you will see on a single page.",

The value of the number per batch (batch size) in each request made to each API, if it is 10, will be 10 results per batch, which is then multiplied by the maximum number of times (deep_search) the request will be made to the libraries.",
